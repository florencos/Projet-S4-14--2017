Note:
	* There are 2 different tones encapsulating in the application and were played alternately to represent 2 different handles. When you have touched one handle 	and with that you find the same one, the application will not warn.
	** This is a temporary traitement so that your action will not influence the background file. The next time after you choose the colors, those handles will still display on the screen.
